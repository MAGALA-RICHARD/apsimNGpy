   **‚ö†Ô∏è Compatibility Warning**

   The APSIM development team has recently made **significant changes to the internal model structure** in the latest versions of APSIM Next Gen.

   As a result, **``apsimNGpy`` is currently not compatible with these newer versions**. This may lead to unexpected errors or failures when attempting to load, manipulate, or run ``.apsimx`` files created or modified with the latest APSIM GUI or binaries.

   **‚úÖ Workaround:** We strongly recommend using an **earlier version of APSIM Next Gen** (e.g., versions prior to the structural changes) until this issue is resolved.

   **üîß Status:** The ``apsimNGpy`` developer team is actively working to update the package to accommodate these upstream changes.

   We appreciate your patience and understanding. If you encounter specific issues, please report them on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/MAGALA-RICHARD/apsimNGpy/issues/29>`_ or contact the development team.

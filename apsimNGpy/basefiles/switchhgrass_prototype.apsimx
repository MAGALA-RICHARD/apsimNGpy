              "Text": "_Rogerio Cichota, Plant and Food Research, New Zealand_\n\n\n## Preamble\n\nWhite clover (*Trifolium repens*) is a herbaceous perennial herb in the Fabaceae family (former Leguminosae) native of Europe and west Asia.  It can now be be found in swards around the world in places with temperate and subtropical climates ([ThomasChapter1987]; [BrockEtAl1989]).  The plant aboveground consists of prostrate segmented stolons, from which tri-foliate leaves grow on top of a 5-15 cm petiole.  From the axils of each leaf emerges either a flower stalk (peduncle) or a branching stolon.  Roots are quite thick and relatively shallow; the initial taproot dies after a year or so, but roots can also grow from each branching stolon.  These rooted stolon behave and can become independent plants. Cultivated varieties are commonly classified into small-, medium- and large-leaved cultivars, which besides leaf size also reflects variations in plant height and proportion of stolons ([CaradusEtAl1989]).  The inflorescence is typically of white colour and grows about one third higher than the leaves.  As a legume, white clover can host N-fixing bacteria (*Rhizobium*) in a symbiotic relationship. N fixation by rhyzobia can tranfer large quantities of N from the atmosphere into the soil.  This is a major reason why white clover is typically sown alongside grasses in pastures.  Nonetheless, white clover is also a valuable forage, producing very high quality feed and is highly palatable to ruminants.  \n\n\n**Objective:**  The model presented here was built to simulate the growth of white clover as a forage crop.  The current model focus on describing biomass accumulation and regrowth after defoliation in monocultural swards.  The model was developed using the Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) and thus, it is readily possible to use the WhiteClover model in mixed swards, but this usage has not been properly tested yet and should be done with caution.  \nThe simulation of variations in N concentration over the growing season can also be considered as incipient and only reasonably good. The model should be updated and its performance revised in the future when more data becomes available.  \n\r\n## Presentation\r\n\r\nThis model has been built using APSIM's Plant Modelling Framework (PMF), as introduced in [brown_plant_2014] and described in more detail in www.apsim.info.  It aims to simulate the development and growth of white clover (*Trifolium repens*) as a forage crop.  The model focus primarily on describing the vegetative growth with only a simplified account of the reproductive phase.  Only an inflorescence organ is defined, so flowers and seeds and their development are not considered separately.  This was done because the reproductive phase of white clover stands is quite long and undefined: different plants may start flowering at different times and single plants may have flower buds as well as ripen seed at the same time (e.g. [HydeEtAl1959]; [Thomas1987Chapter]; [MedeirosAndSteiner2000]); more details in the phenology section below.  With more comprehensive data, the implementation of this phase and the reproductive organs may be revisited in the future.  The white clover model simulates the aboveground plant structure, including the photosynthesis process, using the SimpleLeaf procedure of PMF, which does not consider explicitly leaf age or their placement in the canopy.  The model describes a perennial crop, with phenology rewinding to the vegetative stage at the end of the reproductive phase.  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Inclusion in APSIM simulations\r\nTo include white clover in a simulation the procedure is the same as any other APSIM crop:  \r\n\r\n * The white clover object can be dragged or copied from the Crop folder in the toolbox into a Field in any simulation;  \r\n\r\n * To become active and grow, the white clover crop needs to be sown using a manager script with a sowing rule. e.g.:  \r\n```csharp\r\n    WhiteClover.Sow(cultivar: Huia, population: 450, depth: 5, rowSpacing: 100);\r\n```\r\nIf a specified cultivar is not available, a fatal error will be thrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Harvest and biomass removal\r\nWhite clover biomass can be removed by raising one of the valid methods: Harvest, Cut, Graze, or Prune; this is done using a manager script, similarly to other crops.  The proportion of the biomass of each organ that is removed from the system and/or added to the residue pools may be specified; otherwise defaults will be used.  Note that the sum of fractions removed and added to the residue should be <= 1.0.  To specify the proportions for removal in a manager script, use a RemovalFractions class as shown below:  \r\n```csharp\r\n[EventSubscribe(\"Commencing\")]  \r\nprivate void OnSimulationCommencing(object sender, EventArgs e)  \r\n{  \r\n  RemoveFraction = new RemovalFractions(WhiteClover.Organs);  \r\n}  \r\n[EventSubscribe(\"DoManagement\")]    \r\nprivate void OnDoManagement(object sender, EventArgs e)  \r\n{  \r\n  if (Clock.Today.Date == HarvestDate)  \r\n  {  \r\n    RemoveFraction.SetFractionToRemove(\"Leaf\", 0.80, \"Live\");  \r\n    RemoveFraction.SetFractionToRemove(\"Petiole\", 0.50, \"Live\");  \r\n    RemoveFraction.SetFractionToResidue(\"Leaf\", 0.05, \"Live\");\r\n    RemoveFraction.SetFractionToResidue(\"Petiole\", 0.01, \"Live\");\r\n    WhiteClover.Harvest(RemoveFraction);  \r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default values for the fractions (%) to be removed or transferred to residue are shown below in the description of each organ.\r\n\r\n### Crop termination\r\nTo fully terminate a crop the EndCrop event should be raised:\r\n```csharp\r\n WhiteClover.EndCrop();\r\n```\n\r\nOnce a crop has been ended the field is open to be used by another APSIM plant model, or another white clover crop.  Note that ending white clover is not necessary before sowing another crop, competition for resources will take place between crops when there is more than one in the field.\r\n",

Initially, this phase starts when plants emerge, but it is also triggered as phenology resets after the end of the reproductive phase.  The vegetative phase ends when the inductive phase starts.  \r\nWhite clover is typically described as either short day or short-long day species ([Thomas1961]; [ChapterThomas1980]), which means induction is caused by exposure to short daylight lengths but reproductive growth may also be triggered by a period with long photoperiod.  Exposure to cold temperature can also lead to induction with subsequent initiation of inflorescence development when days become warmer and longer ([Thomas1981_SLD]; [BeattyThesis1959]). The variability in response of induction to environmental conditions are considerably large in white clover. In most stands at least some plants will show reproductive growth regardless of environmental conditions. The variations show some trend when contrasting large- to short-leaved cultivars or for cultivars from different origins (especially latitude), but the effect of genotypes within each group was not found to be significant (e.g. [ChapterThomas1980]; [Thomas1982_Comparison]; [Norris1984_daylength]; [BeattyThesis1959]).  \r\nInducing daylight length seem to be 12 hours or less, while temperatures need to be below about 10^o^C ([Thomas1979_Natural]; [Thomas1981_SLD]; [Thomas1982_Comparison]; [Norris1984_daylength]; [Norris1985_Temperature]).

Physiological and metabolic processes remain the same as for the vegetative phase; plants partition biomass to leaf+petiole, stolon, and root+taproot organs. The inductive phase starts when plants accumulate a given number of days under inductive conditions, i.e. low temperatures and/or short daylight lengths ([Thomas1979_Natural]; [Norris1984_daylength]; [Norris1985_Temperature]).  The phase ends when the plants start reproduction growth, with the emergence of flower buds.  \r\nThere is a large level of variation in white clover plants and their flowering response to environmental conditions, with some plants reaching reproductive growth in almost any stand ([Thomas1979_Natural]; [BeattyThesis1959]). Nonetheless, in natural conditions reproductive growth is typically triggered by long daylight lengths, with reported values around 14 hours ([ChapterThomas1980]; [Thomas1981_SLD];[Norris1984_daylength]).  The accumulation of days under long photoperiod is used by the model to trigger the end of the inductive phase.  \r\n",

                      "Text": "During this phase the plant is partitioning biomass to all organs, including reproductive organs (peduncles, inflorescence, and seeds). The current model does not describe the flower and seeds development explicitly, only a generic organ referred to as *inflorescence* is defined. The main reason for this is the variability and complex phenology of reproduction of white clover; with seeds maturing while new flowers are still being initiated over summer and early autumn (e.g. [HydeEtAl1959]; [Thomas1987Chapter]; [MedeirosAndSteiner2000]). Also due to their similarities and the fact that a population is described in the model (instead of single plants), peduncles and petioles are simulated as a single organ.  \r\nFlower emergence typically starts in spring, peaks at the beginning of summer and continues until autumn ([ChapterThomas1980]; [MacfarlaneAndSheath1984]; [MarshalEtAl1993_Production]). The actual periods vary for different cultivars, and some have flowers nearly all year (albeit with low frequency over winter).  A drop in flower numbers in mid-summer and subsequent increase in early autumn has been shown in some cultivars and has been linked to water deficit or inhibition due to long days ([ChapterThomas1980]; [MacfarlaneAndSheath1984]).  Management practices, such as applying N fertiliser, irrigation and defoliations, have, in general, a positive impact on flower and seed production ([ChapterThomas1980]; [MedeirosAndSteiner2000]; [BissuelBelaygueEtAl2002_flower]), but there is large variation in the responses, depending on the cultivars as well as the extent and timing of the intervention. Currently, the model does not account for the effect of this practices explicitly, although it is expected that some effects are captured by changes in biomass allocation caused by actions such as irrigation of application of fertilisers.\r\n",

The potential demand is computed as the sum of a *Base* and a *Deficit* demand.  The *Base* demand is simply defined by the target proportion of leaf biomass, whereas the *Deficit* demand is defined by the difference between the actual and the targeted proportions.  This approach is used to ensure promptly regrowth of aboveground organs after a defoliation; it relies in the assumption that a target biomass proportion for each organ exists.  The *TargetBiomassProportion* is calculated based on a target shoot-to-root ratio and a biomass proportion for each organ above or below ground, these are defined elsewhere in this documentation and may vary with growth stage and environmental conditions.  \r\n",

The value for SLA for white clover is assumed to be constant in the current model, although the data indicates that age and some environmental factors (shading and nutrient status) have some effect on this value.  Variation due to age are ignored because the model simulates a population, as is intented to describe swards over long term, thus it should represent leaves of varing ages at the same time.  The nutritional effects are generally not linked to N, which currently is the only nutrient simulated in APSIM, thus can be ignored.  The effects of shading, as well as water deficiency, only occur when these conditions are mantained for some time, the model may have to be revised in the future to account for these factors, prefereably with some experimental data.

Inflorescence are ignored as the plant height is mostly used for computing light interception and transpiration.  The petiole length varies with cultivar, being tipically between 5 and 15 cm ([Brougham1958_LeafDev]; [McCreeTroughton1966]; [BissuelBelaygueEtAl2002_flower]; [denHollanderEtAl2007]), and this has been found to be correlated to leaf size.  The inflorescence is typically one third higher than the leaves.

The potential demand is computed as the sum of a *Base* and a *Deficit* demand.  The *Base* demand is simply defined by the target proportion of leaf biomass, whereas the *Deficit* demand is defined by the difference between the actual and the targeted proportions.  This approach is used to ensure promptly regrowth of aboveground organs after a defoliation; it relies in the assumption that a target biomass proportion for each organ exists.  The *TargetBiomassProportion* is calculated based on a target shoot-to-root ratio and a biomass proportion for each organ above or below ground, these are defined elsewhere in this documentation and may vary with growth stage and environmental conditions.  \r\n",

The potential demand is computed as the sum of a *Base* and a *Deficit* demand.  The *Base* demand is simply defined by the target proportion of leaf biomass, whereas the *Deficit* demand is defined by the difference between the actual and the targeted proportions.  This approach is used to ensure promptly regrowth of aboveground organs after a defoliation; it relies in the assumption that a target biomass proportion for each organ exists.  The *TargetBiomassProportion* is calculated based on a target shoot-to-root ratio and a biomass proportion for each organ above or below ground, these are defined elsewhere in this documentation and may vary with growth stage and environmental conditions.  \r\n",

The potential demand is computed as the sum of a *Base* and a *Deficit* demand.  The *Base* demand is simply defined by the target proportion of leaf biomass, whereas the *Deficit* demand is defined by the difference between the actual and the targeted proportions.  This approach is used to ensure promptly regrowth of aboveground organs after a defoliation; it relies in the assumption that a target biomass proportion for each organ exists.  The *TargetBiomassProportion* is calculated based on a target shoot-to-root ratio and a biomass proportion for each organ above or below ground, these are defined elsewhere in this documentation and may vary with growth stage and environmental conditions.  \r\n",

These structures are composed by a mixture of infected and non infected plant cells that behave as isolated organs, but under control of the host plant.  This is a symbiotic relationship whereby the plant supplies carbon and energy to the the bacteria which in turn provide the plant with N fixed from the air.  Nodules of white clover are of indeterminate type, these are more complex than determinate types, including a meristematic zone and have a much longer life span ([PuppoEtAl2005]; [RusselleEtAl2008]).  Different strains of the *Rhizobium* bacteria can vary on their capacity to infect white clover (with some plant cultivars also showing selection to different strains) as well as on their effectiveness to fix N~2~ from the air.  However, the model currently does not simulate variations in nodule development nor on N fixation rate due to varying bacteria strains.  \r\nThe host plant controls the supply of sugars and oxygen to the nodules, thus regulating the N fixation rate and by extention on the nodule's growth and senescence ([PuppoEtAl2005]; [RusselleEtAl2008]; [HaagEtAl2013]). The model simulates this interaction by linking the respective processes in the nodules to the plants N status.  \r\n",

The aproach used in the white clover model to simulate this regulation is to define a base, or mean, target proportion of nodules in the below ground biomass and modify it according to the plants N status.  Thus nodule growth demand is inversely proportional to the plant's N deficiency factor.  \r\n*Rhizobium* bacteria are ubiquitous in soils (e.g. [CrushChapter1987]; [VlassakEtAl1997]; [RusselleEtAl2008]), although strains vary widelly in infection capacities and fixation efficiencies.  Thus, in typical growing conditions nearly all white clover plants will have some nodulation, add to this the fact that the model simulates a population instead of a single plant, the model assumes that nodule biomass never goes below a minimum threshold, as propotion of below ground biomass.

This approach is used to ensure promptly regrowth of aboveground organs after a defoliation; it relies in the assumption that a target biomass proportion for each organ exists.  The *TargetBiomassProportion* is calculated based on a target shoot-to-root ratio and a biomass proportion for each organ above or below ground, these are defined elsewhere in this documentation and may vary with growth stage and environmental conditions.  \r\n",

The whiteclover model uses an approach whereby the basic fixation rate is directly proportional to the biomass of nodules ([RysAndPhung1985]; [LedgardEtAl1990]; [HoghJensenEtAl2002]; [RusselleEtAl2008]; [FloraThesis2013]).  This is then regulated by environmental factors and the plant itself ([CrushChapter1987]; [RusselleEtAl2008]). The plants control N fixation by limiting the supply of sugars and oxygen to the nodules ([PuppoEtAl2005]; [RusselleEtAl2008]; [HaagEtAl2013]). In the model, this is simulated as a function of N deficiency over the whole plant, with fixation rate being inversely proportional to the plant's N deficiency factor.  The mechanism regulating N fixation is quite responsive, with fixation nearly ceasing soon after fertilisation or defoliation (e.g. [CarrollGresshoff1983]; [RusselleEtAl2008]) and this is captured in the model by a prompt reduction of the N deficiency factor.  By linking potential fixation to nodule's biomass, the model is also capable of describing both an upper limit for fixation (due to nodule growth being limited due to the competition for biomass among organs) and the temporal lag between the inception of N stress and an elevated N fixation rate (nodules need to grow before they can start fixing N).  \r\n",

These are primarily considered as storage organs, its researves can be made available to boost plant growth in spring and/or following a defoliation.  \r\nTaproots in white clover are generally efemerous.  They develop from seeds and are ubiquitous in young plants, but these generally die out about a year after germination and adult plants are often described as having no taproots ([HartChapter1987]; [BrockEtAl2000]).  However, some secondary roots can be taproot-like, especially in especific cultivars, e.g. ladino ([ThomasChapter1987]; [CaradusAndWoodfield1998]). Given that, and because the model simulates the a whole population, it is assumed that taproots are always present, but typically constitute a minor fraction of the root systems in most cultivars.  \r\n",

The value is computed as the sum of a base demand, simply based on the potential partition according to the target proportions, and a deficit demand, which diverts more biomass to organs that deviate from their targeted proportions. This ensures faster regrowth of above ground organs after defoliation. The target proportion may vary with growth stage and environmental conditions.  \r\n",

The potential demand is computed as the sum of a base and a deficit demands.  The base demand is simply defined by the target proportion of leaf biomass, whereas the deficit demand is defined by the difference between the actual and targeted proportions.  This approach ensures promptly regrowth of aboveground organs after defoliation, but relies in the assumption that a target biomass proportion for each organ exist.  The target proportion is calculated based on a target shoot-to-root ratio and then a biomass proportion for each organ, these are defined elsewhere in this documentation and may vary with growth stage and environmental conditions.  \r\n",

The approach ensures that biomass allocation is shifted to the appropriate organs when the balance is disturbed, especially important for recovery after defoliation.  Studies have show that white clover, unlike most plants, has a relatively fixed proportion of biomass above ground, even during reproductive phase (e.g. [ChapterThomas1980]). The model uses the target shoot-to-root ratio to compute the proportion of biomass above ground (e.g. [JohnsonAndThornley1987]).  \r\n",

The version Tahora 2 is a bit more tollerant than the original and has been used over a wide range of conditions.  Tahora shows high persistence under grazing, it has a prostrate growth habit, with a dense stolons structure that provide many growing points for fast recovery after defoliation.  The stolons spread well and the plant develops a finely branched fibrous root system, enabling it to compete well with most grasses.  This cultivar has also short petioles, which results in a relatively low harvest index; the performance of Tahora in yield trials showed it can produce as much as Huia, but considerably less than modern cultivars.  \r\n",

It was bred for improved persistence, being able to cope with drought and it is also resistant to several diseases and tolerant to clever root weevil.  The plants have a semi-prostrate growth habit, with high stolon density.  Leaf size is about the same as Huia's and thus plant height and harvest index are assumed to be similar.  Nonetheless, production levels are significantly greater all year round than those of Huia or Sustain, but especially over winter.  The cultivar is considered well suited for all grazing systems.  \r\n",

The current model does not describe the flower and seeds development explicitly, only a generic organ referred to as *inflorescence* is defined. The main reason for this is the variability and complex phenology of reproduction of white clover; with seeds maturing while new flowers are still being initiated over summer and early autumn (e.g. [HydeEtAl1959]; [Thomas1987Chapter]; [MedeirosAndSteiner2000]). Also due to their similarities and the fact that a population is described in the model (instead of single plants), peduncles and petioles are simulated as a single organ.  \r\nFlower emergence typically starts in spring, peaks at the beginning of summer and continues until autumn ([ChapterThomas1980]; [MacfarlaneAndSheath1984]; [MarshalEtAl1993_Production]). The actual periods vary for different cultivars, and some have flowers nearly all year (albeit with low frequency over winter).  A drop in flower numbers in mid-summer and subsequent increase in early autumn has been shown in some cultivars and has been linked to water deficit or inhibition due to long days ([ChapterThomas1980]; [MacfarlaneAndSheath1984]).  Management practices, such as applying N fertiliser, irrigation and defoliations, have, in general, a positive impact on flower and seed production ([ChapterThomas1980]; [MedeirosAndSteiner2000]; [BissuelBelaygueEtAl2002_flower]), but there is large variation in the responses, depending on the cultivars as well as the extent and timing of the intervention. Currently, the model does not account for the effect of this practices explicitly, although it is expected that some effects are captured by changes in biomass allocation caused by actions such as irrigation of application of fertilisers.\r\n",

Physiological and metabolic processes remain the same as for the vegetative phase; plants partition biomass to leaf+petiole, stolon, and root+taproot organs. The inductive phase starts when plants accumulate a given number of days under inductive conditions, i.e. low temperatures and/or short daylight lengths ([Thomas1979_Natural]; [Norris1984_daylength]; [Norris1985_Temperature]).  The phase ends when the plants start reproduction growth, with the emergence of flower buds.  \r\nThere is a large level of variation in white clover plants and their flowering response to environmental conditions, with some plants reaching reproductive growth in almost any stand ([Thomas1979_Natural]; [BeattyThesis1959]). Nonetheless, in natural conditions reproductive growth is typically triggered by long daylight lengths, with reported values around 14 hours ([ChapterThomas1980]; [Thomas1981_SLD];[Norris1984_daylength]).  The accumulation of days under long photoperiod is used by the model to trigger the end of the inductive phase.  \r\n",

It succeeded Pitau and Kopu cultivars, being more persistent than these due to greater stolon density; it has also greater resistance to nematodes and clover root weevil.  As a *large-leaf* cultivar, Kopu2 has leaves that are 25-50% larger than Huia, with corresponding longer petioles; it has a semi-prostrate growth habit, enabling higher harvest index than *medium-leaf* cultivars.  Kopu2 has been shown to produce high yields, especially in early season, being more winter active that the previous cultivars; it is intended for lowland pastures under rotational cattle grazing.  \r\n",

Initially, this phase starts when plants emerge, but it is also triggered as phenology resets after the end of the reproductive phase.  The vegetative phase ends when the inductive phase starts.  \r\nWhite clover is typically described as either short day or short-long day species ([Thomas1961]; [ChapterThomas1980]), which means induction is caused by exposure to short daylight lengths but reproductive growth may also be triggered by a period with long photoperiod.  Exposure to cold temperature can also lead to induction with subsequent initiation of inflorescence development when days become warmer and longer ([Thomas1981_SLD]; [BeattyThesis1959]). The variability in response of induction to environmental conditions are considerably large in white clover. In most stands at least some plants will show reproductive growth regardless of environmental conditions. The variations show some trend when contrasting large- to short-leaved cultivars or for cultivars from different origins (especially latitude), but the effect of genotypes within each group was not found to be significant (e.g. [ChapterThomas1980]; [Thomas1982_Comparison]; [Norris1984_daylength]; [BeattyThesis1959]).  \r\nInducing daylight length seem to be 12 hours or less, while temperatures need to be below about 10^o^C ([Thomas1979_Natural]; [Thomas1981_SLD]; [Thomas1982_Comparison]; [Norris1984_daylength]; [Norris1985_Temperature]). The base white clover model uses the accumulation of days under either low temperature or short photoperiod to trigger the end of the vegetative phase.\r\n",

Physiological and metabolic processes remain the same as for the vegetative phase; plants partition biomass to leaf+petiole, stolon, and root+taproot organs. The inductive phase starts when plants accumulate a given number of days under inductive conditions, i.e. low temperatures and/or short daylight lengths ([Thomas1979_Natural]; [Norris1984_daylength]; [Norris1985_Temperature]).  The phase ends when the plants start reproduction growth, with the emergence of flower buds.  \r\nThere is a large level of variation in white clover plants and their flowering response to environmental conditions, with some plants reaching reproductive growth in almost any stand ([Thomas1979_Natural]; [BeattyThesis1959]). Nonetheless, in natural conditions reproductive growth is typically triggered by long daylight lengths, with reported values around 14 hours ([ChapterThomas1980]; [Thomas1981_SLD];[Norris1984_daylength]).  The accumulation of days under long photoperiod is used by the model to trigger the end of the inductive phase.  \r\n",

The current model does not describe the flower and seeds development explicitly, only a generic organ referred to as *inflorescence* is defined. The main reason for this is the variability and complex phenology of reproduction of white clover; with seeds maturing while new flowers are still being initiated over summer and early autumn (e.g. [HydeEtAl1959]; [Thomas1987Chapter]; [MedeirosAndSteiner2000]). Also due to their similarities and the fact that a population is described in the model (instead of single plants), peduncles and petioles are simulated as a single organ.  \r\nFlower emergence typically starts in spring, peaks at the beginning of summer and continues until autumn ([ChapterThomas1980]; [MacfarlaneAndSheath1984]; [MarshalEtAl1993_Production]). The actual periods vary for different cultivars, and some have flowers nearly all year (albeit with low frequency over winter).  A drop in flower numbers in mid-summer and subsequent increase in early autumn has been shown in some cultivars and has been linked to water deficit or inhibition due to long days ([ChapterThomas1980]; [MacfarlaneAndSheath1984]).  Management practices, such as applying N fertiliser, irrigation and defoliations, have, in general, a positive impact on flower and seed production ([ChapterThomas1980]; [MedeirosAndSteiner2000]; [BissuelBelaygueEtAl2002_flower]), but there is large variation in the responses, depending on the cultivars as well as the extent and timing of the intervention. Currently, the model does not account for the effect of this practices explicitly, although it is expected that some effects are captured by changes in biomass allocation caused by actions such as irrigation of application of fertilisers.\r\n",

It succeeded Pitau and Kopu cultivars, being more persistent than these due to greater stolon density; it has also greater resistance to nematodes and clover root weevil.  As a *large-leaf* cultivar, Kopu2 has leaves that are 25-50% larger than Huia, with corresponding longer petioles; it has a semi-prostrate growth habit, enabling higher harvest index than *medium-leaf* cultivars.  Kopu2 has been shown to produce high yields, especially in early season, being more winter active that the previous cultivars; it is intended for lowland pastures under rotational cattle grazing.  \r\n",

It is authored by Richard Magala, who can be contacted at \nrmagala@iastate.edu. The script makes use of several models, including the APSIM Shared Utilities, the Soil model, and the Plant \nGrowth and Development model. The script defines several input parameters, including the sowing date, rotation period/cycle for \nreplanting, and the initialization year. It also specifies the bionergy crop planting information, such as the cultivar to be sown, \nsowing depth, row spacing, and plant population. The OnDoManagement event is used to determine when the crop should be sown based on \nthe current date and the rotation cycle. If the current year is the same as the initialization year, and the current date falls within \nthe sowing window specified by the user, the pasture may still be alive from the previous cycle, so the script will terminate it before \nsowing the new crop. If the number of years passed is a multiple of the rotation cycle, and the current date falls within the sowing window\n specified by the user, the script will sow the new crop.\n*/\nusing APSIM.Shared.Utilities;\r\nusing Models.Utilities;\r\nusing Models.Soils;\r\nusing Models.PMF;\r\nusing Models.Core;\r\nusing System;\r\n\r\nnamespace Models\r\n{\r\n    [Serializable]\r\n    public class Script : Model\r\n    {\r\n        [Link] Clock Clock;\r\n        [Link] Fertiliser Fertiliser;\r\n        [Link] Summary Summary;\r\n        [Link] Soil Soil;\n        [Link(ByName = true)] Plant TropicalPasture;\r\n        \r\n        [Description(\"Crop\")]\r\n        public IPlant Crop { get; set; }\n        \r\n        [Separator(\"Date related info\")]\n        [Description(\"Sowing day of the year\")]\n        public int SowDate { get; set; }\r\n        [Description(\"starting year\")]\n        public int YearStarting {get; set;}\r\n        [Description(\"Rotation period/Cycle for replanting (Number of years)\")]\r\n        public double RotationCycle { get; set; }\n        \r\n        [Separator(\" Bionergy crop planting information\")]\r\n        [Display(Type = DisplayType.CultivarName)]\r\n        [Description(\"Cultivar to be sown\")]\r\n        public string CultivarName { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [Description(\"Sowing depth (mm)\")]\r\n        public double SowingDepth { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [Description(\"Row spacing (mm)\")]\r\n        public double RowSpacing { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [Description(\"Plant population (/m2)\")]\r\n        public double Population { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [EventSubscribe(\"DoManagement\")]\n        private void OnDoManagement(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n        {\n        //\n              \n        //int Day = int.Parse(PlantingDay.ToString());\n        int counter = 0;\n        int Yearscounting =0;\n        // Get the current date\n         var currentDate = Clock.Today; \n        // create datestring to sow for every cycle\n        counter += 1;\n        \n        int StartYear = currentDate.Year;\n        \n        int YearPassed = StartYear - YearStarting;\n       // This will count the number of years from the start of the simulation and we will check whther this is a multiple of the rotation cycle to change the cycle\n        \n        Yearscounting += StartYear;\n        //if (currentDate.Year == startDate.Year && DateUtilities.WithinDates(SowDate, Clock.Today, SowDate ))\n        if (Clock.Today.DayOfYear == SowDate && YearPassed == 0)\n        {\n        TropicalPasture.Sow(population: Population, cultivar: CultivarName, depth: SowingDepth, rowSpacing: RowSpacing); \n        Summary.WriteMessage(this, $\" A rotation cycle has started: year passed, {YearPassed}\", MessageType.Information);\n        }\n        \n        // Check if the number of years passed is a multiple of the RotationCycle specified by the user and the the time passed the start of the simulation is greater than 0\n        else if (YearPassed % RotationCycle == 0 && Clock.Today.DayOfYear == (int)(SowDate) && YearPassed >1 )\n        {\n        // The bionergy crop maybe alive now we need to terminate it before we plant in the next cycle\n        //&& DateUtilities.WithinDates(DateString, Clock.Today, DateString)\n        if (TropicalPasture.IsAlive)\n           {\n           TropicalPasture.EndCrop();\n           }\n        TropicalPasture.Sow(population: Population, cultivar: CultivarName, depth: SowingDepth, rowSpacing: RowSpacing); \n        Summary.WriteMessage(this, $\" A new rotation cycle has started: year passed, {YearPassed}\", MessageType.Information);\n       \n        }\n       \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n",

Initially, this phase starts when plants emerge, but it is also triggered as phenology resets after the end of the reproductive phase.  The vegetative phase ends when the inductive phase starts.  \r\nWhite clover is typically described as either short day or short-long day species ([Thomas1961]; [ChapterThomas1980]), which means induction is caused by exposure to short daylight lengths but reproductive growth may also be triggered by a period with long photoperiod.  Exposure to cold temperature can also lead to induction with subsequent initiation of inflorescence development when days become warmer and longer ([Thomas1981_SLD]; [BeattyThesis1959]). The variability in response of induction to environmental conditions are considerably large in white clover. In most stands at least some plants will show reproductive growth regardless of environmental conditions. The variations show some trend when contrasting large- to short-leaved cultivars or for cultivars from different origins (especially latitude), but the effect of genotypes within each group was not found to be significant (e.g. [ChapterThomas1980]; [Thomas1982_Comparison]; [Norris1984_daylength]; [BeattyThesis1959]).  \r\nInducing daylight length seem to be 12 hours or less, while temperatures need to be below about 10^o^C ([Thomas1979_Natural]; [Thomas1981_SLD]; [Thomas1982_Comparison]; [Norris1984_daylength]; [Norris1985_Temperature]). The base white clover model uses the accumulation of days under either low temperature or short photoperiod to trigger the end of the vegetative phase.\r\n",

Physiological and metabolic processes remain the same as for the vegetative phase; plants partition biomass to leaf+petiole, stolon, and root+taproot organs. The inductive phase starts when plants accumulate a given number of days under inductive conditions, i.e. low temperatures and/or short daylight lengths ([Thomas1979_Natural]; [Norris1984_daylength]; [Norris1985_Temperature]).  The phase ends when the plants start reproduction growth, with the emergence of flower buds.  \r\nThere is a large level of variation in white clover plants and their flowering response to environmental conditions, with some plants reaching reproductive growth in almost any stand ([Thomas1979_Natural]; [BeattyThesis1959]). Nonetheless, in natural conditions reproductive growth is typically triggered by long daylight lengths, with reported values around 14 hours ([ChapterThomas1980]; [Thomas1981_SLD];[Norris1984_daylength]).  The accumulation of days under long photoperiod is used by the model to trigger the end of the inductive phase.  \r\n",

The current model does not describe the flower and seeds development explicitly, only a generic organ referred to as *inflorescence* is defined. The main reason for this is the variability and complex phenology of reproduction of white clover; with seeds maturing while new flowers are still being initiated over summer and early autumn (e.g. [HydeEtAl1959]; [Thomas1987Chapter]; [MedeirosAndSteiner2000]). Also due to their similarities and the fact that a population is described in the model (instead of single plants), peduncles and petioles are simulated as a single organ.  \r\nFlower emergence typically starts in spring, peaks at the beginning of summer and continues until autumn ([ChapterThomas1980]; [MacfarlaneAndSheath1984]; [MarshalEtAl1993_Production]). The actual periods vary for different cultivars, and some have flowers nearly all year (albeit with low frequency over winter).  A drop in flower numbers in mid-summer and subsequent increase in early autumn has been shown in some cultivars and has been linked to water deficit or inhibition due to long days ([ChapterThomas1980]; [MacfarlaneAndSheath1984]).  Management practices, such as applying N fertiliser, irrigation and defoliations, have, in general, a positive impact on flower and seed production ([ChapterThomas1980]; [MedeirosAndSteiner2000]; [BissuelBelaygueEtAl2002_flower]), but there is large variation in the responses, depending on the cultivars as well as the extent and timing of the intervention. Currently, the model does not account for the effect of this practices explicitly, although it is expected that some effects are captured by changes in biomass allocation caused by actions such as irrigation of application of fertilisers.\r\n",

It succeeded Pitau and Kopu cultivars, being more persistent than these due to greater stolon density; it has also greater resistance to nematodes and clover root weevil.  As a *large-leaf* cultivar, Kopu2 has leaves that are 25-50% larger than Huia, with corresponding longer petioles; it has a semi-prostrate growth habit, enabling higher harvest index than *medium-leaf* cultivars.  Kopu2 has been shown to produce high yields, especially in early season, being more winter active that the previous cultivars; it is intended for lowland pastures under rotational cattle grazing.  \r\n",

It is authored by Richard Magala, who can be contacted at \nrmagala@iastate.edu. The script makes use of several models, including the APSIM Shared Utilities, the Soil model, and the Plant \nGrowth and Development model. The script defines several input parameters, including the sowing date, rotation period/cycle for \nreplanting, and the initialization year. It also specifies the bionergy crop planting information, such as the cultivar to be sown, \nsowing depth, row spacing, and plant population. The OnDoManagement event is used to determine when the crop should be sown based on \nthe current date and the rotation cycle. If the current year is the same as the initialization year, and the current date falls within \nthe sowing window specified by the user, the pasture may still be alive from the previous cycle, so the script will terminate it before \nsowing the new crop. If the number of years passed is a multiple of the rotation cycle, and the current date falls within the sowing window\n specified by the user, the script will sow the new crop.\n*/\nusing APSIM.Shared.Utilities;\r\nusing Models.Utilities;\r\nusing Models.Soils;\r\nusing Models.PMF;\r\nusing Models.Core;\r\nusing System;\r\n\r\nnamespace Models\r\n{\r\n    [Serializable]\r\n    public class Script : Model\r\n    {\r\n        [Link] Clock Clock;\r\n        [Link] Fertiliser Fertiliser;\r\n        [Link] Summary Summary;\r\n        [Link] Soil Soil;\n        [Link(ByName = true)] Plant TropicalPasture;\r\n        \r\n        [Description(\"Crop\")]\r\n        public IPlant Crop { get; set; }\n        \r\n        [Separator(\"Date related info\")]\n        [Description(\"Sowing day of the year\")]\n        public int SowDate { get; set; }\r\n        [Description(\"starting year\")]\n        public int YearStarting {get; set;}\r\n        [Description(\"Rotation period/Cycle for replanting (Number of years)\")]\r\n        public double RotationCycle { get; set; }\n        \r\n        [Separator(\" Bionergy crop planting information\")]\r\n        [Display(Type = DisplayType.CultivarName)]\r\n        [Description(\"Cultivar to be sown\")]\r\n        public string CultivarName { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [Description(\"Sowing depth (mm)\")]\r\n        public double SowingDepth { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [Description(\"Row spacing (mm)\")]\r\n        public double RowSpacing { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [Description(\"Plant population (/m2)\")]\r\n        public double Population { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [EventSubscribe(\"DoManagement\")]\n        private void OnDoManagement(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n        {\n        //\n              \n        //int Day = int.Parse(PlantingDay.ToString());\n        int counter = 0;\n        int Yearscounting =0;\n        // Get the current date\n         var currentDate = Clock.Today; \n        // create datestring to sow for every cycle\n        counter += 1;\n        \n        int StartYear = currentDate.Year;\n        \n        int YearPassed = StartYear - YearStarting;\n       // This will count the number of years from the start of the simulation and we will check whther this is a multiple of the rotation cycle to change the cycle\n        \n        Yearscounting += StartYear;\n        //if (currentDate.Year == startDate.Year && DateUtilities.WithinDates(SowDate, Clock.Today, SowDate ))\n        if (Clock.Today.DayOfYear == SowDate && YearPassed == 0)\n        {\n        TropicalPasture.Sow(population: Population, cultivar: CultivarName, depth: SowingDepth, rowSpacing: RowSpacing); \n        Summary.WriteMessage(this, $\" A rotation cycle has started: year passed, {YearPassed}\", MessageType.Information);\n        }\n        \n        // Check if the number of years passed is a multiple of the RotationCycle specified by the user and the the time passed the start of the simulation is greater than 0\n        else if (YearPassed % RotationCycle == 0 && Clock.Today.DayOfYear == (int)(SowDate) && YearPassed >1 )\n        {\n        // The bionergy crop maybe alive now we need to terminate it before we plant in the next cycle\n        //&& DateUtilities.WithinDates(DateString, Clock.Today, DateString)\n        if (TropicalPasture.IsAlive)\n           {\n           TropicalPasture.EndCrop();\n           }\n        TropicalPasture.Sow(population: Population, cultivar: CultivarName, depth: SowingDepth, rowSpacing: RowSpacing); \n        Summary.WriteMessage(this, $\" A new rotation cycle has started: year passed, {YearPassed}\", MessageType.Information);\n       \n        }\n       \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n",

Initially, this phase starts when plants emerge, but it is also triggered as phenology resets after the end of the reproductive phase.  The vegetative phase ends when the inductive phase starts.  \r\nWhite clover is typically described as either short day or short-long day species ([Thomas1961]; [ChapterThomas1980]), which means induction is caused by exposure to short daylight lengths but reproductive growth may also be triggered by a period with long photoperiod.  Exposure to cold temperature can also lead to induction with subsequent initiation of inflorescence development when days become warmer and longer ([Thomas1981_SLD]; [BeattyThesis1959]). The variability in response of induction to environmental conditions are considerably large in white clover. In most stands at least some plants will show reproductive growth regardless of environmental conditions. The variations show some trend when contrasting large- to short-leaved cultivars or for cultivars from different origins (especially latitude), but the effect of genotypes within each group was not found to be significant (e.g. [ChapterThomas1980]; [Thomas1982_Comparison]; [Norris1984_daylength]; [BeattyThesis1959]).  \r\nInducing daylight length seem to be 12 hours or less, while temperatures need to be below about 10^o^C ([Thomas1979_Natural]; [Thomas1981_SLD]; [Thomas1982_Comparison]; [Norris1984_daylength]; [Norris1985_Temperature]). The base white clover model uses the accumulation of days under either low temperature or short photoperiod to trigger the end of the vegetative phase.\r\n",

Physiological and metabolic processes remain the same as for the vegetative phase; plants partition biomass to leaf+petiole, stolon, and root+taproot organs. The inductive phase starts when plants accumulate a given number of days under inductive conditions, i.e. low temperatures and/or short daylight lengths ([Thomas1979_Natural]; [Norris1984_daylength]; [Norris1985_Temperature]).  The phase ends when the plants start reproduction growth, with the emergence of flower buds.  \r\nThere is a large level of variation in white clover plants and their flowering response to environmental conditions, with some plants reaching reproductive growth in almost any stand ([Thomas1979_Natural]; [BeattyThesis1959]). Nonetheless, in natural conditions reproductive growth is typically triggered by long daylight lengths, with reported values around 14 hours ([ChapterThomas1980]; [Thomas1981_SLD];[Norris1984_daylength]).  The accumulation of days under long photoperiod is used by the model to trigger the end of the inductive phase.  \r\n",

The current model does not describe the flower and seeds development explicitly, only a generic organ referred to as *inflorescence* is defined. The main reason for this is the variability and complex phenology of reproduction of white clover; with seeds maturing while new flowers are still being initiated over summer and early autumn (e.g. [HydeEtAl1959]; [Thomas1987Chapter]; [MedeirosAndSteiner2000]). Also due to their similarities and the fact that a population is described in the model (instead of single plants), peduncles and petioles are simulated as a single organ.  \r\nFlower emergence typically starts in spring, peaks at the beginning of summer and continues until autumn ([ChapterThomas1980]; [MacfarlaneAndSheath1984]; [MarshalEtAl1993_Production]). The actual periods vary for different cultivars, and some have flowers nearly all year (albeit with low frequency over winter).  A drop in flower numbers in mid-summer and subsequent increase in early autumn has been shown in some cultivars and has been linked to water deficit or inhibition due to long days ([ChapterThomas1980]; [MacfarlaneAndSheath1984]).  Management practices, such as applying N fertiliser, irrigation and defoliations, have, in general, a positive impact on flower and seed production ([ChapterThomas1980]; [MedeirosAndSteiner2000]; [BissuelBelaygueEtAl2002_flower]), but there is large variation in the responses, depending on the cultivars as well as the extent and timing of the intervention. Currently, the model does not account for the effect of this practices explicitly, although it is expected that some effects are captured by changes in biomass allocation caused by actions such as irrigation of application of fertilisers.\r\n",

It succeeded Pitau and Kopu cultivars, being more persistent than these due to greater stolon density; it has also greater resistance to nematodes and clover root weevil.  As a *large-leaf* cultivar, Kopu2 has leaves that are 25-50% larger than Huia, with corresponding longer petioles; it has a semi-prostrate growth habit, enabling higher harvest index than *medium-leaf* cultivars.  Kopu2 has been shown to produce high yields, especially in early season, being more winter active that the previous cultivars; it is intended for lowland pastures under rotational cattle grazing.  \r\n",

It is authored by Richard Magala, who can be contacted at \nrmagala@iastate.edu. The script makes use of several models, including the APSIM Shared Utilities, the Soil model, and the Plant \nGrowth and Development model. The script defines several input parameters, including the sowing date, rotation period/cycle for \nreplanting, and the initialization year. It also specifies the bionergy crop planting information, such as the cultivar to be sown, \nsowing depth, row spacing, and plant population. The OnDoManagement event is used to determine when the crop should be sown based on \nthe current date and the rotation cycle. If the current year is the same as the initialization year, and the current date falls within \nthe sowing window specified by the user, the pasture may still be alive from the previous cycle, so the script will terminate it before \nsowing the new crop. If the number of years passed is a multiple of the rotation cycle, and the current date falls within the sowing window\n specified by the user, the script will sow the new crop.\n*/\nusing APSIM.Shared.Utilities;\r\nusing Models.Utilities;\r\nusing Models.Soils;\r\nusing Models.PMF;\r\nusing Models.Core;\r\nusing System;\r\n\r\nnamespace Models\r\n{\r\n    [Serializable]\r\n    public class Script : Model\r\n    {\r\n        [Link] Clock Clock;\r\n        [Link] Fertiliser Fertiliser;\r\n        [Link] Summary Summary;\r\n        [Link] Soil Soil;\n        [Link(ByName = true)] Plant TropicalPasture;\r\n        \r\n        [Description(\"Crop\")]\r\n        public IPlant Crop { get; set; }\n        \r\n        [Separator(\"Date related info\")]\n        [Description(\"Sowing day of the year\")]\n        public int SowDate { get; set; }\r\n        [Description(\"starting year\")]\n        public int YearStarting {get; set;}\r\n        [Description(\"Rotation period/Cycle for replanting (Number of years)\")]\r\n        public double RotationCycle { get; set; }\n        \r\n        [Separator(\" Bionergy crop planting information\")]\r\n        [Display(Type = DisplayType.CultivarName)]\r\n        [Description(\"Cultivar to be sown\")]\r\n        public string CultivarName { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [Description(\"Sowing depth (mm)\")]\r\n        public double SowingDepth { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [Description(\"Row spacing (mm)\")]\r\n        public double RowSpacing { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [Description(\"Plant population (/m2)\")]\r\n        public double Population { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [EventSubscribe(\"DoManagement\")]\n        private void OnDoManagement(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n        {\n        //\n              \n        //int Day = int.Parse(PlantingDay.ToString());\n        int counter = 0;\n        int Yearscounting =0;\n        // Get the current date\n         var currentDate = Clock.Today; \n        // create datestring to sow for every cycle\n        counter += 1;\n        \n        int StartYear = currentDate.Year;\n        \n        int YearPassed = StartYear - YearStarting;\n       // This will count the number of years from the start of the simulation and we will check whther this is a multiple of the rotation cycle to change the cycle\n        \n        Yearscounting += StartYear;\n        //if (currentDate.Year == startDate.Year && DateUtilities.WithinDates(SowDate, Clock.Today, SowDate ))\n        if (Clock.Today.DayOfYear == SowDate && YearPassed == 0)\n        {\n        TropicalPasture.Sow(population: Population, cultivar: CultivarName, depth: SowingDepth, rowSpacing: RowSpacing); \n        Summary.WriteMessage(this, $\" A rotation cycle has started: year passed, {YearPassed}\", MessageType.Information);\n        }\n        \n        // Check if the number of years passed is a multiple of the RotationCycle specified by the user and the the time passed the start of the simulation is greater than 0\n        else if (YearPassed % RotationCycle == 0 && Clock.Today.DayOfYear == (int)(SowDate) && YearPassed >1 )\n        {\n        // The bionergy crop maybe alive now we need to terminate it before we plant in the next cycle\n        //&& DateUtilities.WithinDates(DateString, Clock.Today, DateString)\n        if (TropicalPasture.IsAlive)\n           {\n           TropicalPasture.EndCrop();\n           }\n        TropicalPasture.Sow(population: Population, cultivar: CultivarName, depth: SowingDepth, rowSpacing: RowSpacing); \n        Summary.WriteMessage(this, $\" A new rotation cycle has started: year passed, {YearPassed}\", MessageType.Information);\n       \n        }\n       \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n",

There is little information about these thresholds for white clover. The minimum, or base, temperature is quite variable among cultivars, varying from -1.0 to 5^o^C ([BlackEtAl2006]; [MonksEtAl2009]; [MootEtAll2000]). Even less data is found for the other parameters, and they are quite variable too; optimum temperature is around 28^o^C and 38^o^C for maximum temperature ([BlackEtAl2006]; [MonksEtAl2009]).\r\n",

Best emergence rates occur when seeds are sown at depth of 5mm ([Hyde1950]; [MurrayAndClements1993]), and few plants will emerge from seeds deeper than 40mm.  Variations in germination rate due to depth are not currently simulated by the model, however the sowing depth does affect timing of emergence, in combination with temperature.  This is controlled by the parameter ShootRate, which is the shoot elongation rate as function of thermal time (mm/oCd).  \r\nEmergence of white clover occurs a few days after germination ([Hyde1950]; [MootEtAll2000]), but this is quite variable (taking 5-20 days).  Both temperature and depth of seed are important factors.  Thermal time for the emergence of white clover (cv. Huia and Nomad) has been reported as being approximately 150oCd ([MootEtAll2000]; [MurrayThesis2012]), and there seem to be no significant variations between NZ cultivars ([HamptonEtAl1987]).  \r\n",

Initially, this phase starts when plants emerge, but it is also triggered as phenology resets after the end of the reproductive phase.  The vegetative phase ends when the inductive phase starts.  \r\nWhite clover is typically described as either short day or short-long day species ([Thomas1961]; [ChapterThomas1980]), which means induction is caused by exposure to short daylight lengths but reproductive growth may also be triggered by a period with long photoperiod.  Exposure to cold temperature can also lead to induction with subsequent initiation of inflorescence development when days become warmer and longer ([Thomas1981_SLD]; [BeattyThesis1959]). The variability in response of induction to environmental conditions are considerably large in white clover. In most stands at least some plants will show reproductive growth regardless of environmental conditions. The variations show some trend when contrasting large- to short-leaved cultivars or for cultivars from different origins (especially latitude), but the effect of genotypes within each group was not found to be significant (e.g. [ChapterThomas1980]; [Thomas1982_Comparison]; [Norris1984_daylength]; [BeattyThesis1959]).  \r\nInducing daylight length seem to be 12 hours or less, while temperatures need to be below about 10^o^C ([Thomas1979_Natural]; [Thomas1981_SLD]; [Thomas1982_Comparison]; [Norris1984_daylength]; [Norris1985_Temperature]). The base white clover model uses the accumulation of days under either low temperature or short photoperiod to trigger the end of the vegetative phase.\r\n",

Physiological and metabolic processes remain the same as for the vegetative phase; plants partition biomass to leaf+petiole, stolon, and root+taproot organs. The inductive phase starts when plants accumulate a given number of days under inductive conditions, i.e. low temperatures and/or short daylight lengths ([Thomas1979_Natural]; [Norris1984_daylength]; [Norris1985_Temperature]).  The phase ends when the plants start reproduction growth, with the emergence of flower buds.  \r\nThere is a large level of variation in white clover plants and their flowering response to environmental conditions, with some plants reaching reproductive growth in almost any stand ([Thomas1979_Natural]; [BeattyThesis1959]). Nonetheless, in natural conditions reproductive growth is typically triggered by long daylight lengths, with reported values around 14 hours ([ChapterThomas1980]; [Thomas1981_SLD];[Norris1984_daylength]).  The accumulation of days under long photoperiod is used by the model to trigger the end of the inductive phase.  \r\n",

The current model does not describe the flower and seeds development explicitly, only a generic organ referred to as *inflorescence* is defined. The main reason for this is the variability and complex phenology of reproduction of white clover; with seeds maturing while new flowers are still being initiated over summer and early autumn (e.g. [HydeEtAl1959]; [Thomas1987Chapter]; [MedeirosAndSteiner2000]). Also due to their similarities and the fact that a population is described in the model (instead of single plants), peduncles and petioles are simulated as a single organ.  \r\nFlower emergence typically starts in spring, peaks at the beginning of summer and continues until autumn ([ChapterThomas1980]; [MacfarlaneAndSheath1984]; [MarshalEtAl1993_Production]). The actual periods vary for different cultivars, and some have flowers nearly all year (albeit with low frequency over winter).  A drop in flower numbers in mid-summer and subsequent increase in early autumn has been shown in some cultivars and has been linked to water deficit or inhibition due to long days ([ChapterThomas1980]; [MacfarlaneAndSheath1984]).  Management practices, such as applying N fertiliser, irrigation and defoliations, have, in general, a positive impact on flower and seed production ([ChapterThomas1980]; [MedeirosAndSteiner2000]; [BissuelBelaygueEtAl2002_flower]), but there is large variation in the responses, depending on the cultivars as well as the extent and timing of the intervention. Currently, the model does not account for the effect of this practices explicitly, although it is expected that some effects are captured by changes in biomass allocation caused by actions such as irrigation of application of fertilisers.\r\n",

It succeeded Pitau and Kopu cultivars, being more persistent than these due to greater stolon density; it has also greater resistance to nematodes and clover root weevil.  As a *large-leaf* cultivar, Kopu2 has leaves that are 25-50% larger than Huia, with corresponding longer petioles; it has a semi-prostrate growth habit, enabling higher harvest index than *medium-leaf* cultivars.  Kopu2 has been shown to produce high yields, especially in early season, being more winter active that the previous cultivars; it is intended for lowland pastures under rotational cattle grazing.  \r\n",

It is authored by Richard Magala, who can be contacted at \nrmagala@iastate.edu. The script makes use of several models, including the APSIM Shared Utilities, the Soil model, and the Plant \nGrowth and Development model. The script defines several input parameters, including the sowing date, rotation period/cycle for \nreplanting, and the initialization year. It also specifies the bionergy crop planting information, such as the cultivar to be sown, \nsowing depth, row spacing, and plant population. The OnDoManagement event is used to determine when the crop should be sown based on \nthe current date and the rotation cycle. If the current year is the same as the initialization year, and the current date falls within \nthe sowing window specified by the user, the pasture may still be alive from the previous cycle, so the script will terminate it before \nsowing the new crop. If the number of years passed is a multiple of the rotation cycle, and the current date falls within the sowing window\n specified by the user, the script will sow the new crop.\n*/\nusing APSIM.Shared.Utilities;\r\nusing Models.Utilities;\r\nusing Models.Soils;\r\nusing Models.PMF;\r\nusing Models.Core;\r\nusing System;\r\n\r\nnamespace Models\r\n{\r\n    [Serializable]\r\n    public class Script : Model\r\n    {\r\n        [Link] Clock Clock;\r\n        [Link] Fertiliser Fertiliser;\r\n        [Link] Summary Summary;\r\n        [Link] Soil Soil;\n        [Link(ByName = true)] Plant TropicalPasture;\r\n        \r\n        [Description(\"Crop\")]\r\n        public IPlant Crop { get; set; }\n        \r\n        [Separator(\"Date related info\")]\n        [Description(\"Sowing day of the year\")]\n        public int SowDate { get; set; }\r\n        [Description(\"starting year\")]\n        public int YearStarting {get; set;}\r\n        [Description(\"Rotation period/Cycle for replanting (Number of years)\")]\r\n        public double RotationCycle { get; set; }\n        \r\n        [Separator(\" Bionergy crop planting information\")]\r\n        [Display(Type = DisplayType.CultivarName)]\r\n        [Description(\"Cultivar to be sown\")]\r\n        public string CultivarName { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [Description(\"Sowing depth (mm)\")]\r\n        public double SowingDepth { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [Description(\"Row spacing (mm)\")]\r\n        public double RowSpacing { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [Description(\"Plant population (/m2)\")]\r\n        public double Population { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [EventSubscribe(\"DoManagement\")]\n        private void OnDoManagement(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n        {\n        //\n              \n        //int Day = int.Parse(PlantingDay.ToString());\n        int counter = 0;\n        int Yearscounting =0;\n        // Get the current date\n         var currentDate = Clock.Today; \n        // create datestring to sow for every cycle\n        counter += 1;\n        \n        int StartYear = currentDate.Year;\n        \n        int YearPassed = StartYear - YearStarting;\n       // This will count the number of years from the start of the simulation and we will check whther this is a multiple of the rotation cycle to change the cycle\n        \n        Yearscounting += StartYear;\n        //if (currentDate.Year == startDate.Year && DateUtilities.WithinDates(SowDate, Clock.Today, SowDate ))\n        if (Clock.Today.DayOfYear == SowDate && YearPassed == 0)\n        {\n        TropicalPasture.Sow(population: Population, cultivar: CultivarName, depth: SowingDepth, rowSpacing: RowSpacing); \n        Summary.WriteMessage(this, $\" A rotation cycle has started: year passed, {YearPassed}\", MessageType.Information);\n        }\n        \n        // Check if the number of years passed is a multiple of the RotationCycle specified by the user and the the time passed the start of the simulation is greater than 0\n        else if (YearPassed % RotationCycle == 0 && Clock.Today.DayOfYear == (int)(SowDate) && YearPassed >1 )\n        {\n        // The bionergy crop maybe alive now we need to terminate it before we plant in the next cycle\n        //&& DateUtilities.WithinDates(DateString, Clock.Today, DateString)\n        if (TropicalPasture.IsAlive)\n           {\n           TropicalPasture.EndCrop();\n           }\n        TropicalPasture.Sow(population: Population, cultivar: CultivarName, depth: SowingDepth, rowSpacing: RowSpacing); \n        Summary.WriteMessage(this, $\" A new rotation cycle has started: year passed, {YearPassed}\", MessageType.Information);\n       \n        }\n       \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n",

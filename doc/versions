Version 1.5
--------------
Moved pythonet_config from the core module to the starter module to improve module organization and initialization flow.

Verified compatibility with the latest APSIM binary (build 7980).

Added a __len__ dunder method to ApsimModel, enabling len(model) to return the number of loaded simulations. this method internally calls
 Internally calls len(self.simulations).

Added a __getitem__ dunder method to ApsimModel, enabling model[index] or model[str] to return a simulation matching the specified index or name, respectively

Ensures the model is saved before evaluation to prevent inconsistencies from simulations lingering in memory.

Deprecated:
- evaluate_simulated_output() will be removed in v1.6.0.
  Use evaluate() instead.
- preview_simulation() will be removed in in v1.6.0
  use open_in_gui() instead
- inspect_file() will be removed in v1.6.0
use tree()

apsimNGpy.bin_context method class now lazily load all apsimNgpy objects that requires .Net and APSIM bin path.
in the same lense, Apsim class is introduced on apsimNGpy module to allow users to dynamically manage different apsim versions in the different scripts or the projects.
this implies that users can either load Apsim class in auto mode, no bin path provided, or provide a bin path to load apsim related modules;

# **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) â€“ apsimNGpy**

### **1. What is `apsimNGpy`?**

`apsimNGpy` is a Python package that provides a programmatic interface to the APSIM Next Generation (APSIM-X) platform. It allows users to automate simulations, manipulate model components, edit parameters, and analyze outputs within a Python workflow.

---

### **2. What can I do with `apsimNGpy`?**

With `apsimNGpy`, you can:

* Programmatically load, edit, and run `.apsimx` simulations.
* Batch process simulations with varying inputs.
* Extract and analyze simulation outputs.
* Calibrate and validate APSIM models using Python tools.
* Build scalable and reproducible agroecosystem modeling workflows.

---

### **3. Is `apsimNGpy` compatible with all APSIM Next Generation versions?**

Yes. `apsimNGpy` is designed to be compatible with APSIM Next Generation (APSIM-X), and it interacts with the APSIM binaries through the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) using `pythonnet`. Make sure your installed version of APSIM-X matches your simulation needs.

---

### **4. What are the prerequisites for using `apsimNGpy`?**

To use `apsimNGpy`, you'll need:

* **Python 3.10+**
* **.NET Core/Framework** compatible with your APSIM-X installation
* **APSIM Next Generation** installed
* `pythonnet` package installed (`pip install pythonnet`)
* Other dependencies like `pandas`, `numpy`, etc.

---

### **5. How do I install `apsimNGpy`?**

If hosted on PyPI:

```bash
pip install apsimNGpy
```

Otherwise, you can clone it from the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/apsimNGpy.git
cd apsimNGpy
pip install -e .
```

---

### **6. Can I run APSIM simulations in parallel?**

Yes. `apsimNGpy` supports parallel execution of simulations using Python's `multiprocessing` or parallel task managers. However, ensure that simultaneous access to APSIM executables does not create conflicts or file access issues.

---

### **7. How do I edit parameters in an APSIM model using `apsimNGpy`?**

You can use the `edit_model()` method to modify components in the model tree:

```python
from apsimNGpy.core.apsim import ApsimModel
sim = ApsimModel("path/to/model.apsimx")
sim.edit_model(model_type='Clock', model_name='Clock', Start =  "1990-04-15")
```

---

### **8. Does `apsimNGpy` support calibration and optimization?**

Yes. You can integrate `apsimNGpy` with Python packages like `scipy`, `DEAP`, or `optuna` to perform model calibration and optimization routines.

---

### **9. How do I extract simulation outputs?**

Simulation outputs can be read using:

```python
from apsimNGpy.core.apsim import ApsimModel
sim = ApsimModel("path/to/model.apsimx")
sim.run()
outputs = sim.get_simulatated_output(report_name="Report")
```

This returns a `pandas.DataFrame` containing the simulation results.

---

### **10. Can I contribute to `apsimNGpy`?**

Yes! We welcome contributions. You can fork the repository, submit issues or feature requests, and open pull requests on GitHub. Please ensure your changes are tested and documented.

---

### **11. Who maintains `apsimNGpy`?**

`apsimNGpy` is developed and maintained by researchers and developers working on crop modeling, with contributions from the APSIM user community. Check the GitHub repository for maintainers and collaborators.

---

### **12. Where can I get help?**

* Official documentation (link)
* GitHub issues page for bug reports and questions
* Community forums and APSIM support groups
* Email the maintainers (if provided)
